	<h1>Our Homelessness Social Issue</h1>
  	<p>Our team was tasked with the ability of showing a social issue to the world in a tech-related format. 
	We wanted to do a problem that was more people-related. We decided on doing homelessness. Here is our process from beginning to end:</p>
	  
	  <h2>Cause & Effect Model of our Information</h2>
	  
	  <p>This is a cause and effect model of our evidence of how homelessness is affecting the world.</p>

	  <h2>How Our Ideas and Characters Came Alive</h2>
	  
	  <p>To create our animation we needed people to populate our story. Our characters needed to be real human beings so that they could express 
		  the emotion and the harshness of the actual reality. Our storyboard was the representation of the severity that we were going to 
		  portray.</p>
